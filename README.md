# cloufiles-manager (cfmgr)

cloudfiles-manager is a command-line tool to manage your Rackspace Cloudfiles. You can create new
containers, upload directories and files to those containers, and use a special file to define which
files and directories to add to which containers.

It's not even done yet, so I can't document it.

Install it like this:

    npm install cloudfiles-manager -g

Enjoy!
